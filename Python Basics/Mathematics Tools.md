 In Python You Can Do Basics Calculation Like Adding, subtracting , etc. Like a Pro.
 ## Example :- 2+4 or 24+56 and More Difficult and Long Ranges Number.
 Same Is Applied For Subtraction, muliplication(*).
 Divide Has Something New Here, If You  want a answer to be Like Not Perfect.
 you can use (/) for answer in Decimal but incase you want Perfect Integer. then USe (//)
 ## Example :- 5/2= 2.5 but 5//2 = 2 (" This Is Difference.")
 Now Last is Mod ("Basically Finding Remainder") 
 ## Example :-- 5%2=1 <--- This Will Give Remainder.
 <----- You can Do calculation of Log, sin0, power, square roots, etc by Importing library Called "math"---->
 <--- Library Is basically a packages which contains Multiple Function By Defined Names--->
 Don't Worry you Will Learn how to create own Library too. In upcoming Notebooks

 <----- LET'S LEARN MATH LIBRARY USE------> (Pyhton is case Sensitive so make sure of Letters captilization)
 1. First for using a Library, you need to call by just typing " import math".
 2. After imorting is done
 ## Example- pow(2,4) = 16
 <---This Will Basically Power the 2 and Give, remember number that need to be pow has to be in first and seperatedby comma have second number by which nu,ber needs to be powered>
 ## Example- math.sin(math.radians(Angle)), remember the Angle Fisrt need To Be In Radian,(<For Converting Angle in Radian, ----->math.radians(Angle)>)
 <-- Now Rather than Doing This, WE LEARN TO ASSIGN VARIBALES FOR STORING VALUES--- >
 1. a= math.radians(angle)  <Angle is your angle and remember the letters Size, small or capital>
 2. math.sin(a) <Rather Than Puting math.radians(angle), we assigned variable for angle that store Value of radians>
 <---- Now For Square Root------>
 1. import math
 2. math.sqrt(your number)  <Here Same logic just put your number in bracket that you want square root>
 <-------------NOW PRINTING IN PYTHON--------->
 1. import math
 2. now rather than writing calculation code
 3. assign it to a variable
 ### Example-- a=math.sqrt(49),
 ### Print(a)
 <<---- This Will Print Your Variable that Have sqrt of 49----->>
          <<<------IF I MISS ANYTHING ADD YOUR CHANGES AND PR--------------->>>
                          <<<------THE END FOR MATH BASICS------>>>
